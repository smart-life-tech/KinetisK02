# KinetisK02
Kinetis K02 64 KB/128 KB Flash 100 MHz ARM® Cortex®-M4 Based Microcontroller with FPU Ideal for low-power applications that require processing efficiency and high peripheral integration. These devices share the comprehensive enablement and scalability of the Kinetis family. This product offers: • Run power consumption down to 117.5 µA/MHz and static power consumption down to 2.8 µA with full state retention and 5.7 µs wakeup. Lowest static mode down to 70 nA. • Excellent processing efficiency, 100 MHz ARM® Cortex®- M4-based device with floating-point unit in a tiny form factor
We will be adding a URL to the new Additional Boards Manager URLs option. The list of URLs is comma separated, and you will only have to add each URL once. New Adafruit boards and updates to existing boards will automatically be picked up by the Board Manager each time it is opened. The URLs point to index files that the Board Manager uses to build the list of available & installed boards.


To find the most up to date list of URLs you can add, you can visit the list of third party board URLs on the Arduino IDE wiki. We will only need to add one URL to the IDE in this example, but you can add multiple URLS by separating them with commas. Copy and paste the link below into the Additional Boards Manager URLs option in the Arduino IDE preferences.
